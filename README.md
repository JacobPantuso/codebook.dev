## Description
Our mission at **codebook.dev** is to make coding **online** easier.
We do this by allowing users to code and execute the written code all within their browser window.<br>

**Here is a look at how it works:**

1. Your code is sent to a secure server which processes your code. 
2. That code is then executed on the secure server
3. The output is then sent back to your browser. <br>

*Your code or personal information is never stored on the server.*
