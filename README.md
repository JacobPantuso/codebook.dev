## Description
our mission at **codebook.dev** is to make coding **online** easier.
we do this by allowing users to code and execute the written code all within their browser window.<br>

**here is a look at how it works:**

1. your code is sent to a secure server which processes your code. 
2. that code is then executed on the secure server
3. the output is then sent back to your browser. <br>

*your code or personal information is never stored on the server.*

### *Ace Editor*
For Syntax Highlighting and the In-Window Terminal / Code Editor, we utilized Ace editor. It is a embeddable code editor written in JavaScript that can be found [here](https://ace.c9.io/). A guide on the framework can be found [here](https://ace.c9.io/#nav=howto) and the API Reference can be retrieved from the website highlighted earlier.
